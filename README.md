# Hungry Plant

Tap the screen to devour different types of bugs. Each bug has a unique effect, such as awarding points/energy, stunning, or filling the energy bar. The energy bar constantly depletes at an increasing speed. You must consume bugs to stay awake. If the energy bar hits 0, your plant will fall asleep, and the game will end. If you're seeking a fun, wholesome game with zero ads or in-game payments, this is the game for you!
